Filtering, Searching, and Ordering

This API supports filtering, searching, and ordering to give users flexibility when retrieving books.

1. Filtering

You can filter books by specific fields.
Example:

GET /books/?publication_year=2020

2. Searching

Search across title and author fields with partial matches.
Example:

GET /books/?search=tolkien


This will return all books with "tolkien" in the title or author field.

3. Ordering

Order the results by one or more fields such as title or publication_year.

Examples:

# Order by title ascending
GET /books/?ordering=title

# Order by title descending
GET /books/?ordering=-title

# Order by publication year descending
GET /books/?ordering=-publication_year

# Order by multiple fields
GET /books/?ordering=publication_year,title

‚öôÔ∏è Default Ordering

If no ordering is specified, results are ordered by title by default.
